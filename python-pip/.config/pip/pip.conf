# Note: From version 6.0 (2014-12-22), pip caches to ~/.cache/pip (or
# $XDG_CACHE_HOME) by default, and ignores the download-cache setting.
#
# Details: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install.html#caching
#
# Until 6.0 becomes the de facto default, older versions of pip still require
# this setting to enable caching (if only to bootstrap local pip upgrades).
# Note that the new builtin cache uses a different filesystem layout than the
# old one, so to allow them to coexist cleanly, this points to a different
# directory than ~/.cache/pip.

# Find built wheels in the shared "pip wheel" cache (see below).

# XXX: This is broken in pip 6.0.8: https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/2453
#find-links = ~/.cache/pip-wheelhouse

[wheel]
# Make "pip wheel" store built wheels to a shared cache, by default
# (instead of ./wheelhouse).
#
# XXX: Note this minor bug with pip 6.0.8 (should be fixed in 6.0.9):
# https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/2442
